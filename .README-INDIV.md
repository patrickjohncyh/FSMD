## How might code be used in team work?

`tableHandler` is part of `blockHandler` which is called whenever a table block is detected by `blockParser`. It has been written to make it easy to accept all forms of table inputs by `blockParser`. 

When given an input of type `string`, `tableHandler` will break up the string into its corrsponding header and body rows. After processing cell contents of every row, the information in each cell can be used to make a DOM element and all the cell DOM elements will be wrapped into 1 large DOM that can be appended to other `Block` level DOMs to form the entire document.


## How will it interface with other team members individual work?

`tableHandler` will interface with `blockParser` to accept inputs, and interface with `inlineParser` to produce outputs. Through continuous discussions, the team has settled on D.U.s and Record types which will hopefully allow for more seameless interfacing and integration.
