## How might code be used in team work?

`inlineParser` serves as the function which Block Handlers will call whenever they require inline parsing for their block content. It has been written to make it easy to add support for additional inline styles. 

When given an input of type `string`, `inlineParser` will break up the string into its corrsponding inline styles. Each inline style is represented by an InlineElement which contains the neccesary information required when forming its corresponding DOM node. Hence, `inlineParser` returns an `inlineElement list` which the Block Parsers will append to their structue.


## How will it interface with other team members individual work?

`inlineParser` does not have much dependency on the layers above it apart from the fact that it must be given a string. However, the layers above it, have high dependency on `inlineParser` especially its return represenation. Therefore, through continuous discussions, the team has settled on D.U.s and Record types which will hopefully allow for more seameless interfacing and integration.
