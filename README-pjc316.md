## Personal Statement
I first added support for Katex for inlineParsers which was my componenet for the Individual Phase. It was not very difficult as the code structure made it fairly easy to support new inline styles.

Then, I performed the initial backend integration, which combines the work from the Individaul Phase together. This involved resolving any potential clashes in types and ensuring that all functions have a single source to refer to for types that are shared. In addition, I wrote the `blockDispatcher` function which gels the entire backend code together. I also had to make some modifications to the groups' work from the individual phase to support the recursive nature of parsing. One such example is the `blockQuoteHandler`, which can call the `blockParser` on its contents. However it still had to call the `blockDispatcher` which could only be defined after `blockQuoteHandler` and all the other Block Handlers were defined. Thus, `blockQuoteHandler` was modified to take in a function as one of its parameters. This function would be the `blockDispatcher` passing itself in when it has to call `blockQuoteHandler`.

Then, I began the interfacing of the frontend code with the backend code. This involved determining which componenets of the Visual2 renderer code were required in order to obtain the information our backend needed and how to modify the DOM to display the results. An intial `blockListToDOM` converter was then written that handled a few simple blocks, which laid the ground work for the other team members to expand on. Raymond had worked with me for this. Whilst working on other parts of the project, I worked with Raymond in implementing certain block types, such as lists, when he required help.

I then proceeded to work on the front end such as the inclusion of `katex` javascript library and also made User Experience modifiations such as Auto-Compilation. In addition, I assisted other team mates whenever they needed help resolving bugs.
