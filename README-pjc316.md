## Personal Statement
I performed the initial backend integration, which combines the work from the Individaul Phase together. This involved resolving any potential clashes in types and ensuring that all functions have a single source to refer to for types that are shared. In addition, I wrote the `blockDispatcher` function which gels the entire backend code together. 

Then, I began the interfacing of the frontend code with the backend code. This involved determining which componenets of the Visual2 renderer code were required in order to obtain the information our backend needed and how to modify the DOM to display the results.

 An intial `blockListToDOM` converter was written that handled a few simple blocks, which laid the ground work for the other team members to expand on.

I then proceeded to work on the front end such as the inclusion of `katex` javascript library and also made User Experience modifiations such as Auto-Compilation. In addition, I assisted other team mates whenever they needed help resolving bugs.
